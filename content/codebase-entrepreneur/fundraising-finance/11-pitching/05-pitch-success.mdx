People tend to stuff lots of highly technical information into their deck and way of speaking. This makes presentations very heavy."</span> - Margo van de Linde, Pitch Coach and Performer

Preparation is the most critical part of your performance when it comes to pitching. Before your presentation, use this anchoring process:
- Identify the key topic per segment, distilling each to a single word
- Connect personally by asking: Why does this matter to me?
- Choose an intentional energy level for each section
- Center yourself by asking "Why am I here today?" and use your answer as a speaking foundation

For five-minute pitches (common in accelerator programs like Codebase):
- Create a deck for a five-minute pitch that is complete enough to get the relevant information across, while being as minimal as possible; containing cue words that trigger script memory.
- Memorize your script thoroughly and practice until delivery feels natural
- Edit ruthlessly—less information with more impact is better
- Strategically set up questions you want to be asked during Q&A

Don't neglect Q&A preparation. Research jury members and their likely question styles, practice handling both easy and difficult questions with your team, and prepare for expertise gaps and technical deep-dives.
