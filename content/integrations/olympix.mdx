## Overview


[Olympix](https://www.olympix.ai) is the only institutional-grade proactive security suite for Web3, purpose-built to identify and prevent vulnerabilities before audits or deployment. Its proprietary architecture (including a custom compiler, intermediate representation (IR), and symbolic execution engine), not LLM-wrappers, powers tools like static analysis, unit test generation, mutation testing, and automated POC generation.


By integrating directly into developer environments (VS Code, GitHub CI/CD), Olympix helps teams catch vulnerabilities early, strengthen audit readiness, and reduce the time and cost of achieving secure deployment on Avalanche and other EVM-compatible chains.

## Features

- Static Analyzer: Detects critical vulnerabilities early in development using advanced symbolic execution and proprietary detectors.

- Unit Test Generation: Automatically generates test suites to improve coverage and resilience of smart contracts.
- Mutation Testing: Measures the robustness of unit tests by simulating bad commits and highlighting which edge cases go undetected.
- Internal Audit Agent: Generates and audit-style report complete with POCs to prove the exploitability of findings.
- Developer Integration: Embedded within IDEs and CI/CD for continuous, proactive security.
- Audit Readiness: Hardens test suites (out of scope of typical audit), reduces audit findings by up to 60%, and shortens remediation cycles.
- Institutional-Grade Precision: 300% better benchmarking performance versus open-source alternatives.


## Getting Started 


To start using Olympix:
1. Visit [Olympix](https://olympix.ai) to request access or schedule a demo.
2. Install the Olympix VS Code or GitHub CI/CD integration.
3. Run static analysis, unit test generation, mutation testing, and internal audit agent on your Avalanche-based smart contracts. 
4. Review findings and fix issues before audit and before deployment.


## Use Cases

Olympix is ideal for:
1. DeFi Protocols: Secure high-value contracts and mitigate risk before audits.
2. Bridges and Cross-Chain Projects: Identify logic and invariant vulnerabilities across EVM environments.
3. Enterprises and Financial Institutions: Embed compliance-grade security early in tokenization and on-chain deployments.
4. Developers on Avalanche: Leverage proactive tooling to minimize risk and accelerate secure releases.

## Conclusion

Olympix brings enterprise-grade, proactive security to Avalancheâ€™s developer ecosystem. By identifying vulnerabilities early and automating testing, it helps projects reduce exploit risk, save audit costs, and build trust with users. Olympix is designed for builders who want to secure smart contracts before audits, enabling safer, faster, and more confident on-chain development.
