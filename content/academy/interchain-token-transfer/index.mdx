In this course, you will learn how to transfer assets across multiple Avalanche blockchains with Avalanche Interchain Token Transfer ICTT.

## Why Take This Course?

A significant innovation in blockchain is the development of multi-chain systems, like Avalanche, which provide a significant improvement in scalability, interoperability, and flexibility. At the core of these multi-chain systems is the ability to run multiple blockchains that communicate. Each chain's VM is optimized for specialized use cases, thereby boosting the network's overall performance.

Cross-chain communication is a crucial building block of multi-chain systems. Utilizing Avalanche Interchain Messaging and Interchain Token Transfer is an incredibly easy way to build cross-Avalanche L1 dApps, since developers can build on top of an extensive, audited development framework. 

Transfering tokens between multiple chains is a common use case in multi-chain systems. This course will help you understand how to transfer assets between multiple Avalanche blockchains using the Avalanche Interchain Token Transfer protocol.

<Callout>
This course focuses on using the existing testnet chains (Fuji C-Chain, Echo, and Dispatch). If you want to create your own L1 blockchain, please refer to the [Creating an L1](/academy/avalanche-fundamentals/04-creating-an-l1/01-creating-an-l1) course.
</Callout>

<Callout>
Since Interchain Token Transfer relies on Interchain Messaging (ICM), you must run your own relayer to enable cross-chain communication. Follow the [Running a Relayer](/academy/interchain-messaging/09-running-a-relayer/01-relayer-introduction) course to set up your relayer.

## Course Content

### Getting Started with Interchain Token Transfer

In this section, you will learn how to use our Interchain Token Transfer toolbox to perform cross-chain operations. We'll guide you through the process of using our user-friendly interface to deploy contracts, create bridges, and transfer assets across the testnet chains (Fuji C-Chain, Echo, and Dispatch).

### Tokens and Token Types

In this section, you will learn about the different types of tokens that can be transferred between Avalanche blockchains. We will cover ERC-20 and native tokens and how to deploy and transfer them using our toolbox. Furthermore, you will learn what wrapped native tokens are and how they can be used to transfer assets between chains.

### Token Bridging

Next we will talk about the high level concepts of token bridging and demonstrate how to use our toolbox to create and manage bridge contracts for cross-chain transfers between the testnet chains.

### Interchain Token Transfer Architecture

In this chapter we will look at the design of Avalanche Interchain Token Transfer. You will learn about the file structure of the contracts and the concepts of the token home and token remote.

### ERC-20 to ERC-20 Bridge Implementation

You will learn how to use our toolbox to deploy ERC-20 tokens and create bridges to transfer them between the testnet chains.

### Multi-Chain Token Operations

Here you will learn about the concept of multi-hops and how to use our toolbox to bridge tokens between multiple testnet chains.

### Native to ERC-20 Bridge Implementation

In this chapter you will learn how to use our toolbox to bridge a native token as an ERC-20 token to another testnet chain.

### Send and Call Operations

In this chapter you will learn how to use our toolbox to call smart contracts with the tokens after sending them to another testnet chain.

### Cross-Chain Token Swaps

In this chapter you will learn how to perform cross-chain token swaps between the testnet chains using our toolbox.

## Prerequisites

### Avalanche Knowledge

This course is intended for people with knowledge about Cross-Chain communication protocols, and a solid understanding of the basic concepts of Avalanche. You should be familiar with these concepts:

1. Avalanche Architecture: Be familiar with Avalanche blockchains.
2. Interchain Messaging: Know how to communicate between two Avalanche blockchains with ICM. 

If some of this is not clear, we strongly recommend taking the Avalanche Fundamentals, Multi-Chain Architecture, and Interchain Messaging courses first.

### Software Development

You will need a general understanding of how to use Web3 applications. We recommend:

1. Basic understanding of how to use Core Wallet
   - Download from [core.app](https://core.app)

2. Test tokens for development
   - Get test AVAX from the [Avalanche Faucet](https://faucet.avax.network)

3. Understanding of token standards (ERC-20, etc.)

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will:

- Understand what Avalanche Interchain Token Transfer is and when to use it.
- Understand the different options for transferring assets between multiple chains.
- Be able to deploy tokens and create bridges using our toolbox.
- Be able to perform cross-chain token transfers between testnet chains using our toolbox.
- Apply the knowledge gained in the course by enabling assets to be transferred between multiple Avalanche blockchains.
