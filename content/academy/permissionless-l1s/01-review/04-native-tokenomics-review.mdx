## What are L1 Native Tokenomics?

L1 Native Tokenomics refers to the economic design and management of native tokens on Layer 1 blockchains. Unlike ERC20 tokens that exist on top of a blockchain, native tokens are the fundamental gas token of the blockchain itself, used for transaction fees and network security.

## Custom Native Token Capabilities

**Custom native tokens** give you complete control over your blockchain's economic model, offering several powerful capabilities:

### Economic Design Control:
- **Custom Tokenomics**: Design token distribution, inflation, and utility to match your project's needs
- **Fee Control**: Set predictable, isolated transaction costs independent of other chains' activity
- **Business Model Flexibility**: Create valueless gas tokens for gas-free experiences or design complex incentive structures

### Native Token Management:
- **Initial Allocation**: Specify how the initial token supply is distributed
- **Minting Rights**: Define who can mint new tokens (hard-capped vs. flexible supply)
- **Fee Configuration**: Configure how transaction fees are calculated and distributed

## Precompiles for Tokenomics

Avalanche L1s use **precompiles** (protocol-level smart contracts) to enable powerful tokenomics features:

### Native Minter Precompile:
- **Supply Management**: Control whether your blockchain has a fixed token supply or can mint additional tokens
- **Minting Rights**: Configure who can mint new tokens and under what conditions
- **Economic Flexibility**: Enable gas-free experiences by minting tokens as needed

### Fee Config Precompile:
- **Transaction Fees**: Configure how transaction fees are calculated
- **Fee Distribution**: Control where fees go (burn, treasury, validators)
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Implement complex fee structures based on network conditions

## Relevance to Proof of Stake

Custom native tokens are **essential for Proof of Stake (PoS) systems** because they provide the economic foundation for validator incentives:

### Staking Token Requirements:
- **Validator Rewards**: Native tokens are distributed as rewards to validators for securing the network
- **Slashing Mechanisms**: Validators can lose their staked native tokens for malicious behavior
- **Economic Security**: The value of the native token directly impacts network security

### PoS Integration:
- **Staking Logic**: Define how nodes become validators through token staking
- **Reward Distribution**: Configure how validator rewards are calculated and distributed
- **Governance Rights**: Native token holders can participate in network governance
