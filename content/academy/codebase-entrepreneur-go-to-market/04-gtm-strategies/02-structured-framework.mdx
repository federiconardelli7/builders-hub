An effective GTM strategy for Web3 follows a structured approach that helps you systematically identify, reach, and convert your target customers.

1. Identify your target company types
2. Define specific target roles within those companies
3. Leverage founder networks for initial client acquisition
4. Build success stories that can be documented and replicated
5. Develop a clear Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
6. Scale through dedicated sales teams once initial traction is achieved
