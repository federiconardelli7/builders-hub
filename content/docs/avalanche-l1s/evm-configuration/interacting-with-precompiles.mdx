## Alternative: Using Remix IDE

For custom precompile implementations or if you prefer a code-based approach, you can use Remix IDE to interact with precompiles directly.

### When to Use Remix

Use Remix when:
- You have a **custom precompile** implementation (non-standard addresses or interfaces)
- You need to interact with precompiles **programmatically**
- You're **debugging** contract interactions
- The Builder Console doesn't support your specific use case

### Prerequisites

- Access to an Avalanche L1 where you have admin/manager rights for a precompile
- [Core Browser Extension](https://core.app) or MetaMask
- Private key for an admin/manager address on your L1
- Your L1's RPC URL and Chain ID

## Setup Your Wallet

### Using Core

1. Install the [Core Browser Extension](https://core.app)
2. Import or create the account with admin/manager privileges
3. Enable **Testnet Mode** (if using testnet):
   - Open Core extension
   - Click hamburger menu → **Advanced**
   - Toggle **Testnet Mode** on

4. Add your L1 network:
   - Click the networks dropdown
   - Select **Manage Networks**
   - Click **Add Network** and enter:
     - **Network Name**: Your L1 name
     - **RPC URL**: Your L1's RPC endpoint
     - **Chain ID**: Your L1's chain ID
     - **Symbol**: Your native token symbol
     - **Explorer**: (Optional) Your L1's explorer URL

5. Switch to your L1 network in the dropdown

### Using MetaMask

1. Install MetaMask browser extension
2. Import the account with admin/manager privileges
3. Add your L1 network:
   - Click the networks dropdown
   - Click **Add Network** → **Add a network manually**
   - Enter your L1's network details
   - Click **Save**

## Connect Remix to Your L1

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) in your browser

2. In the left sidebar, click the **Deploy & run transactions** icon

3. In the **Environment** dropdown, select **Injected Provider - MetaMask** (or Core)

4. Approve the connection request in your wallet extension

5. Verify the connection shows your L1's network (e.g., "Custom (11111) network")

## Load Precompile Interfaces

You need to load the Solidity interfaces for the precompiles you want to interact with.

### Available Precompile Interfaces

From the Remix home screen, use **load from GitHub** to import:

**Required for all precompiles:**
- [IAllowList.sol](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/master/contracts/contracts/interfaces/IAllowList.sol)

**Specific precompile interfaces:**
- [IFeeManager.sol](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/master/contracts/contracts/interfaces/IFeeManager.sol) - For fee configuration
- [INativeMinter.sol](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/master/contracts/contracts/interfaces/INativeMinter.sol) - For minting native tokens
- [IAllowList.sol](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/master/contracts/contracts/interfaces/IAllowList.sol) - For transaction/deployer allowlists
- [IRewardManager.sol](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/master/contracts/contracts/interfaces/IRewardManager.sol) - For block rewards

### Compile the Interface

1. In Remix, click the **Solidity Compiler** icon in the left sidebar
2. Select the precompile interface file (e.g., `IFeeManager.sol`)
3. Click **Compile**

## Interact with Precompiles

### Connect to Deployed Precompile

Each precompile is deployed at a fixed address on your L1:

| Precompile | Address |
|------------|---------|
| NativeMinter | `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000001` |
| ContractDeployerAllowList | `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000000` |
| FeeManager | `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000003` |
| RewardManager | `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000004` |
| TransactionAllowList | `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000002` |

1. In Remix, click **Deploy & run transactions**
2. In the **Contract** dropdown, select your compiled interface
3. Paste the precompile address in the **At Address** field
4. Click **At Address**

The precompile contract will appear in the **Deployed Contracts** section.

## Example: Using Fee Manager

### Read Current Fee Configuration

Anyone can read the current fee configuration (no special permissions required):

1. Expand the FeeManager contract in **Deployed Contracts**
2. Click **getFeeConfig**
3. View the current fee parameters:
   - `gasLimit`: Maximum gas per block
   - `targetBlockRate`: Target time between blocks (seconds)
   - `minBaseFee`: Minimum base fee (wei)
   - `targetGas`: Target gas per second
   - `baseFeeChangeDenominator`: Rate of base fee adjustment
   - `minBlockGasCost`: Minimum gas cost for a block
   - `maxBlockGasCost`: Maximum gas cost for a block
   - `blockGasCostStep`: Increment for block gas cost

### Update Fee Configuration

Only admin addresses can update the fee configuration:

1. Ensure you're connected with the admin address in your wallet
2. Expand **setFeeConfig** in the FeeManager contract
3. Fill in the new fee parameters:
   ```
   gasLimit: 8000000
   targetBlockRate: 2
   minBaseFee: 25000000000
   targetGas: 15000000
   baseFeeChangeDenominator: 36
   minBlockGasCost: 0
   maxBlockGasCost: 1000000
   blockGasCostStep: 200000
   ```
4. Click **transact**
5. Approve the transaction in your wallet
6. Wait for transaction confirmation

The new fee configuration takes effect immediately after the transaction is accepted.

## Example: Using Native Minter

### Mint Native Tokens

Only admin, manager, or enabled addresses can mint native tokens:

1. Expand the NativeMinter contract in **Deployed Contracts**
2. Click on **mintNativeCoin**
3. Fill in the parameters:
   - `addr`: Recipient address (e.g., `0xB78cbAa319ffBD899951AA30D4320f5818938310`)
   - `amount`: Amount to mint in wei (e.g., `1000000000000000000` for 1 token)
4. Click **transact**
5. Approve the transaction in your wallet

The minted tokens are added directly to the recipient's balance by the EVM (no sender transaction).

### Check Minting Permissions

Anyone can check who has minting permissions:

1. Click **readAllowList** with an address parameter
2. Returns:
   - `0`: No permission
   - `1`: Enabled (can mint)
   - `2`: Manager (can mint and manage enabled addresses)  
   - `3`: Admin (full control)

## Example: Managing Allow Lists

### Add Address to Allow List

Admins can add addresses to transaction or deployer allow lists:

1. Expand the AllowList contract
2. Use **setAdmin**, **setManager**, or **setEnabled**:
   ```
   addr: 0x1234...5678
   ```
3. Click **transact**
4. Approve in wallet

### Remove Address from Allow List

1. Use **setNone** with the address:
   ```
   addr: 0x1234...5678
   ```
2. Click **transact**

### Check Address Status

1. Click **readAllowList**:
   ```
   addr: 0x1234...5678
   ```
2. Returns permission level (0-3)

## Best Practices

### Security

- **Never share private keys** for admin addresses
- **Use hardware wallets** for admin accounts when possible
- **Test on testnet first** before making changes on mainnet
- **Use multi-sig contracts** for critical admin operations
- **Document all changes** and announce them to validators

### Network Upgrades

When enabling precompiles via network upgrades:

1. **Announce upgrades** well in advance on social media and Discord
2. **Coordinate with validators** to ensure they update their nodes
3. **Use upgrade.json** to schedule precompile activation (see [Precompile Upgrades](/docs/avalanche-l1s/evm-configuration/precompile-upgrades))
4. **Test the upgrade** on a testnet first
5. **Monitor** the network after activation

### Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**
- Verify your wallet is connected to the correct network
- Check that the RPC URL is accessible
- Ensure you have native tokens for gas fees

**Transaction Failures:**
- Confirm you're using an admin/manager address
- Check that the precompile is enabled on your L1
- Verify parameter formats (addresses must be checksummed)
- Ensure sufficient gas limit

**Precompile Not Found:**
- Verify the precompile address is correct
- Confirm the precompile is activated in your genesis or upgrade.json
- Check that you're on the correct network

## Conclusion

For standard Avalanche L1 precompiles, **we strongly recommend using the [Builder Hub Developer Console tools](/console)** for the best experience. These tools provide:

- ✅ Guided workflows with validation
- ✅ No need to manage contract addresses or ABIs manually  
- ✅ Integration with your Builder Hub account
- ✅ Support from the Builder Hub team

For custom implementations or advanced scenarios, the Remix IDE approach provides flexibility to interact with any contract at any address. This is useful for:

- Custom precompile implementations
- Testing and debugging
- Programmatic interactions
- Non-standard use cases

Whichever method you choose, always test on testnet first and follow security best practices when managing admin keys.
